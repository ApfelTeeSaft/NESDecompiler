# NES Decompiler

A decompilation and disassembly tool for Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) ROMs, providing both assembly output and C-like code generation.

## Features

- **Disassembly**: Convert NES ROM binary data to 6502 assembly code
- **Decompilation**: Generate C-like code from NES ROMs
- **Control Flow Analysis**: Analyze and reconstruct program flow
- **Symbol Recognition**: Identify and label functions and variables
- **Code Navigation**: View and navigate through disassembled/decompiled code
- **Project Management**: Save and load projects with multiple ROMs
- **Workspace System**: Save your progress and continue later
- **Visual Studio Export**: Export decompiled code as a VS2022 solution
- **GUI Interface**: User-friendly interface with syntax highlighting
- **Command-Line Interface**: Automate decompilation tasks

## Requirements

- .NET 8.0 or higher
- Windows with WPF support (for GUI version)

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/apfelteesaft/NESDecompiler/releases) page
2. Extract the files to a directory of your choice
3. Run `NESDecompiler.GUI.exe` for the graphical interface or `NESDecompiler.CLI.exe` for command-line usage

## Usage

### GUI

1. Launch `NESDecompiler.GUI.exe`
2. Open a NES ROM file using File â†’ Open ROM...
3. The application will automatically disassemble and decompile the ROM
4. Navigate through different views (Disassembly, C Code, Variables, Functions)
5. Save your project or export to Visual Studio

### Command Line

```
NESDecompiler.CLI.exe -i input.nes -o output_directory [-d] [-c] [-v]
```

Options:
- `-i, --input`: Input NES ROM file path (required)
- `-o, --output`: Output directory for generated files
- `-d, --disassemble`: Generate disassembly output (default: false)
- `-c, --decompile`: Generate C code output (default: true)
- `-v, --verbose`: Set output to verbose messages

Example:
```
NESDecompiler.CLI.exe -i SuperMario.nes -o mario_src -d -c -v
```

## Project Structure

- **NESDecompiler.Core**: Core decompilation and analysis engine
  - CPU: 6502 CPU instruction set and emulation components
  - Disassembly: Conversion of binary to assembly
  - Decompilation: Conversion of assembly to C code
  - ROM: NES ROM format parsing and handling
  
- **NESDecompiler.CLI**: Command-line interface application

- **NESDecompiler.GUI**: Graphical user interface
  - WPF-based interface with dockable panels
  - Syntax highlighting for both assembly and C code
  - Project management features

## Technical Notes

- The decompiled C code is a best-effort representation and may not be 100% accurate
- The C code is intended as a pseudocode representation to assist in understanding the original assembly
- Some ROMs may contain custom hardware or timing-critical code that doesn't translate well to C
- The generated Visual Studio projects include a NES hardware abstraction layer to allow testing the decompiled code

## Limitations

- Some features are not fully implemented or may contain bugs
- The C code generation is approximate and might require manual adjustments
- Some complex control flow structures might not be correctly identified
- Custom mappers and ROM formats might not be fully supported
